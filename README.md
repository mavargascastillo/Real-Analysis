# Real Analysis – Independent Summer Study

This folder documents my independent study of **Real Analysis** over Summer 2025, based on the MIT OpenCourseWare 18.100C course: *Analysis I*. See the full course here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-100a-real-analysis-fall-2020/

## 📚 Structure

Each week follows:
- 📽️ 2 lectures (from MIT OCW)
- 🧠 1 recitation-style review
- ✍️ Handwritten notes (PDF)
- 🔢 Selected problem solutions (LaTeX)

## 🗂️ Contents

- /notes/ → Handwritten PDF notes (weekly)
- /proofs/ → Formal proofs in LaTeX
- /problems/ → Solutions to selected problem sets

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- Real numbers and completeness
- Sequences, limits, Cauchy sequences
- Continuity and uniform continuity
- Compactness
- Derivatives and differentiability
- Mean Value Theorems
- Integration theory (Riemann)

## ✏️ Why I'm Studying This

My school only offers Real Analysis once every two years, so I want to take it now as I consider it a fundamental course in my mathematical career. Furthermore, I might want to pursue graduate studies in mathematics in the future, so I want to strengthen my foundation in rigorous analysis and proof-writing.
